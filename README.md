# Bounce Counter 
Created June 2012

## Description

This program was created to allow Judges to rank pogo competitors on various criteria.  Pogopalooza was an annual pogo stick competition that included various tricks and categories of competitions.  

This was built to run on Android 7 and was written in Java.  PHP was used to create GET/POST APIs that would connect to the database.  My charity webstie [Bounce to a Cure](http://bouncetoacure.com/) hosted the database the app used.
